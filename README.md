# Text-Summarizer-with-BART
This project uses the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model from the transformers library to generate automatic text summaries. The user can either provide text directly or upload a text file to be summarized. The script allows for adjusting the minimum and maximum length of the generated summary.
